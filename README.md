# Machine-Learning-Robot-Movement
This copies the 2D movements of a user after training on a users movement. Its intended use is for studying teleoperation and telepresence with signal loss when users are no longer available but want a robot to replicate their movement intermittantly.


# Tele_operation-Computatinon
Optimizing tele-operation procedures using various computational algorithms.

After running the GUI file and hitting the "Training" Button, name your character or movement you would like to use in the terminal.

Once your policy has been created, in the "Policies" folder in the folder name you created to train on, drag the "imitation_policy.csv" file to the "POILICY_TO_DRAW" folder and replace the file to use that file for teleoperation. The default in the folder is for the lowercase letter a and will be imported in the GUI when you press the "IMPORT" button.
